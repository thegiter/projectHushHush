      Home Page

	<p>
      The homepage is the first ever page I made for this website. It is rather simple.
	</p>
	<p>
		Design wise, it was purposefully made to work in 1920 &#215 1080 resolutions. This was due to my love for big screens and my short sight for the future of mobile devices. As you will find out, many of the pages in this site are, like the home page, not mobile friendly. Although, I am starting to adopt responsive design now.
	</p>
	<p>
		Nevertheless, I feel that there is still some points that shine in the home page that I can talk about.

		<h4>
			Large Area for Image and Abstract Background
		</h4>
		
		<figure id="ab-img-cnr" class="img-resp-cnr larg-scrn-min-3 pos-rel">
			<div id="ab-img-bg">
			</div>
			<div id="ab-img-shadow">
			</div>
  		</figure>
		
		<section class="clr-dbl-aft" title="Text Content">
			<p>
				The design of the home page is that it will serve as an entrance to the site with a big splash image welcoming the visitors. There will not be a lot of info or details on the home page. Like the cover of a book, people will actually have to open the book to read it.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is just because I like big stuffs. Wasting space is one of my favourite. To achieve this, the left side of the page is the image area where the image can be changed without affecting the background.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then to cover the rest of the area, a background abstract picture was used, which extends itself all the way up to the image area, where it turns from black and white to colored. This abstract background is separate from the splash image, so that the splash image can be changed without affecting the background.

			Preview of the Latest News
		</h4>
		
		<section class="clr-dbl-aft" title="Text Content">
			<p>
				On the right hand side of the home page, is a small preview of the news section featuring a list of the latest news. Because the news section is done with WordPress and the home page is not part of the news section, the home page accesses the WordPress database to get the necessary info and displays them on the home page. So, the news info displayed here is always automatically up to date, and not updated manually every time.
