How To Documentation

The ajax sys and module sys loads files from manifest files, then triggers the onload and intro methods of the page or module or component loaded.

In your manifest files, indicate the necessary files that must be loaded in order for the page to initialize, and the order for those files to install.

Then in your methods, load additional files in your methods and you can decide when is the best time to load them.

The additional files you load can then be cached or non cached based on their importance.

E.g, in modules manager, you would set cached param to true, in total element onloader, you would use blob url to indicate it must be cached.
